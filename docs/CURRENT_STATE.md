## 1. Completed Work

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Architecture Planning
- [x] Initialized Next.js (v16.3.6) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, App Router, and `src/` directory.
- [x] Established core project documentation (`PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, local `AI_HANDOFF.md`).
- [x] Established agent prompt files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- [x] Established 7 route placeholders: `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/projects/[slug]`, `/experience`, `/stack`, `/contact`.

### Phase 2 — Visual Foundation & Nav Shell
- [x] Design System Tokens: Configured dark warm cinematic design tokens, CSS variables, and Google Fonts (`Syne`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`, `JetBrains Mono`) in `globals.css` and `layout.tsx`.
- [x] Atmospheric Background: Built [`AtmosphericBackground.tsx`](file:///d:/Documents/PARTH/PortfolioWebsite/portfolio/src/components/AtmosphericBackground.tsx) with film grain texture, radial vignette, and ambient glowing light.
- [x] Fixed Right Navigation Shell: Built [`NavigationShell.tsx`](file:///d:/Documents/PARTH/PortfolioWebsite/portfolio/src/components/NavigationShell.tsx), [`MenuButton.tsx`](file:///d:/Documents/PARTH/PortfolioWebsite/portfolio/src/components/MenuButton.tsx), and [`NavOverlay.tsx`](file:///d:/Documents/PARTH/PortfolioWebsite/portfolio/src/components/NavOverlay.tsx).

### Phase 3 — The Abandoned Archive: Homepage Pivot
- [x] **Pivoted from Typography Curtain to Abandoned Archive Environment**: Removed 400vh scroll sequence; installed approved background image `public/images/archive-room.png` as 1672:941 aspect-ratio environment canvas.
- [x] **ADR-006**: Documented architectural pivot decision in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Phase 3A — CRT Screen Alignment, Glass Integration & Typography Polish
- [x] **Removed Card/Box Appearance from CRT Overlay ([`CrtTerminal.tsx`](file:///d:/Documents/PARTH/PortfolioWebsite/portfolio/src/components/CrtTerminal.tsx))**:
  - Eliminated all rectangular UI cards, opaque background gradients, borders, and card box-shadows.
  - Made the terminal container completely transparent (`bg-transparent`), letting all underlying CRT glass cracks, reflections, and curvature details from `archive-room.png` remain 100% visible.
  - The green phosphor monospace text (`SYSTEM ERROR`, `PARTH_ARCHIVE`, `[ CLICK ME ]`) now renders as pure glowing phosphor characters directly on the glass.
  - Added subtle, organic phosphor flicker animation (`@keyframes crt-phosphor-flicker` in `globals.css`) with `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
  - Hover / focus state subtly intensifies the green phosphor text glow and highlights `[ CLICK ME ]` with a pointer cursor and no rectangular hover box.
- [x] **Precise Inner Glass Alignment**:
  - Aligned the interactive target to match the inner curved CRT glass boundary (`left: 72.4%`, `top: 43.5%`, `width: 14.4%`, `height: 21.2%`, `rotate(-3.6deg) skewX(-1.2deg)`).
  - Maintained click action navigating to `/projects`.
- [x] **Website Accent Typography Color Refinement**:
  - Replaced the orange accent color on `RESEARCH ARCHIVE // DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT` and `AI • SOFTWARE • SECURITY` with a muted, desaturated sage-grey (`#B8C6BE`).
  - Preserved the warm off-white main display typography (`PARTH`, `COMPUTER SCIENCE`) and existing interface metadata accents (amber dot, divider line).
  - Eliminates visual competition with the room's warm sunset window lighting.
- [x] **Desktop & Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - Verified layout across desktop (1540x800, 1920x1080) and mobile (375x812).
  - On mobile, identity text sits cleanly in the upper third while the glowing CRT monitor is unobstructed in the lower half.
- [x] **Visual Review & Approval**: Visually reviewed and explicitly approved by the user.

## 2. Current Work
- Phase 3A visually approved. Creating local commit `feat: refine CRT terminal overlay`.

---

## 3. Known Issues / Blockers
- None.

---

## 4. Next Recommended Phase (Phase 3B / Phase 4)
- **Target:** Subtle environmental animations (fluorescent light flicker, water droplets, dust) or beginning portfolio content routes (`/projects`, `/about`, etc.).
- **Wait for user explicit prompt before starting.**

---

## 5. Verification Log
- `npm run build`: **SUCCESS** (0 TypeScript/lint errors, all 9 routes compiled cleanly in 3.2s).
- **Console & Hydration Check**: 0 errors/warnings (`[HMR] connected`).
- **Visual Desktop Verification**: Confirmed transparent CRT overlay with glowing phosphor text directly on glass; underlying glass cracks completely visible; sage-grey `#B8C6BE` accent typography applied.
- **CRT Hover & Navigation**: Confirmed text glow intensifies on hover without card border; clicking CRT navigates to `/projects`.
- **Mobile Verification**: Confirmed 375x812 layout with zero text overlap and unobstructed clickable CRT monitor.
